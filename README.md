The goal of this project is to create a visually engaging 3D environment using Babylon.js, with easy extensibility and features like model loading, camera control, texture application, and interactive effects. Special visual effects like fire, snow, and lasers are also included to add dynamism, alongside the ability to incorporate background music.

Key Features:

Interactive camera control: Full freedom to explore the scene.
GLB model loading: Load and display 3D models in GLB format.
Textured ground and columns: Realistic textures applied to environment elements.
3D scene with transparent background: Clean and clear visual setup.
Easy to extend and customize: Flexible design for adding new elements.
Special effects: Includes fire, snow, and laser effects for enhanced visual experience.
